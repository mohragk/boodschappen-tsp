Test algorithm for handling the Travelling Sales man Problem, server side.

## Info
This script is developed to run server-side to solve the shortest route in a supermarket. A client app can be used to create a personal shopping list. Depending on what items are on the list, a route can be determined between the different, relevant sections in the store. This script tries to generate the shortest route between these sections.
